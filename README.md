# 🧠 Server & Client Component Architecture

The application separates responsibilities between:

---

## 🖥️ Server Components

Used for:

- Secure Supabase data fetching
- Server-side rendering
- Initial dashboard rendering
- Query prefetching

Examples:

```text
app/page.tsx
courses.functions.ts
```

---

## 💻 Client Components

Used for:

- Framer Motion animations
- Interactive UI behavior
- Hover interactions
- Sidebar micro-interactions

Examples:

```text
DashboardContainer.tsx
HeroTile.tsx
ActivityTile.tsx
```

---

# 📊 Bento Dashboard Layout

The dashboard uses a premium Bento Grid system.

---

## 📌 Sidebar Navigation

Features:

- Animated active states
- Responsive collapse behavior
- Framer Motion layout animations

---

## 🧩 Main Dashboard Area

Contains:

- Hero Tile
- Dynamic Course Tiles
- Activity Tile
- Learning statistics

---

# ✨ Animation System

Animations are powered entirely using:

```text
Framer Motion
```

---

## 🎬 Implemented Animations

### ✅ Staggered Page Load

Dashboard tiles animate sequentially with:

- Fade effects
- Y-axis translation
- Spring-based motion

---

### ✅ Card Hover Effects

Cards feature:

- Scale animations
- Gradient glow borders
- Smooth spring physics

---

### ✅ Sidebar Micro-Interactions

Navigation items use:

```text
layoutId animations
```

for smooth active-state movement.

---

# ⚡ Performance Optimizations

The application is optimized for:

- Zero layout shifts
- GPU-accelerated transforms
- Smooth rendering performance
- Minimal browser repaints
- Efficient hydration

---

# 🗄️ Supabase Integration

Course data is dynamically fetched from Supabase using secure server-side fetching.

---

## 📋 Database Schema

### `courses`

| Column | Type |
|--------|------|
| id | uuid |
| title | text |
| progress | integer |
| icon_name | text |
| created_at | timestamp |

---
